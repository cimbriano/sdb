* Describe contents of the directory.

Directory Structure

+ bin   - Compiled java classes
+ lib   - External libraries needed for project
+ src   - Source files (both ours and those provided)
+ doc   - README, Project Report
demo    - Script to install project and demonstrate functionality
 

Installation

* Run './demo install' from the root of the project.  This will compile the classes into the bin folder.

* Run './demo make-accounts' to create a new acct.db if there isn't one, and to optionally add new accounts.

* Run './demo bank' to start a BankServer

* Run './demo atm <atm#> <host>' to start an atm with atm number <atm#> and host <host>.  If the bank and atm server
    are local, use 'localhost' for the <host> parameter.

* Run './demo log <regexp>' to dump the contents of the log to stdout. 
    Note:   It is useful to use an ATM session number as the regexp to see just 
            those log message pertaining to that ATM session.
