* Describe contents of the directory.

Directory Structure

+ bin   - Compiled java classes
+ lib   - External libraries needed for project
+ src   - Source files (both ours and those provided)
+ doc   - README, Project Report
demo    - Script to install project and demonstrate functionality
 

Installation

* Run './demo install' from the root of the project.  This will compile the classes into the bin folder.

* Run './demo bank' to start a BankServer

* Run './demo atm <atm#> <host>' to start an atm with atm number <atm#> and host <host>.  If the bank and atm servers are 
        local, use 'localhost' for the <host> parameter.



Requirements and Protocol Description
1. Authentication Algorithm
    * Meet criteria outlined (in assignment spec)

    * ATM should verify Bank's authenticity
    * ATM should obtain account owner's name (display it)
    * Establish AES session key
    * Server should verify user's authenticity
    * Obtain account number
    * Obtain ATM identifier
    * Establish shared session key with ATM
    * Based on RSA encryption
    
    
    
    
2. Transaction Protocol
    * Meets criteria for confidentiality
    
    * No attack may modify or read contents of the transactions
    * Bank should obtain enough information during a transaction to convince a third party
       that the transaction was initiated by the user
    * Based on AES encryption and RSA signatures

3. Cryptographic Audit Log
    * Protected against unauthorized disk accesses
    * Only BankServer uses the log
    * Justify the information recorded in the log
    

Threat Types and Mitigation

* Passive Attacker
  - Read Meassages

* Active Attacker
  - Replay attacks
  - Changed messages
  - New messages generated

* Insecure log storage
  - Unauthorized Read
  - 

1. Authorship considered suspect
2. Deleted Messages
