Contributions

Together we spent a couple hours reading through the project specification
   and drawing out an architecture/protocol diagram that would satisfy the requirements
   
Dustin then spent about 5 hours implementing the authentication, transaction and some of the logging protocols we designed.

We then met to finalize discussions of how the logging would be handled to 
  satisfy non-repudiation and completed its implementation.
  
Dustin spent some more time implementing the log reading extra credit feature, while
  Chris focused on the written requirements.
